Land Use Land Cover Project
Overview
This project analyzes geographical aspects of land use using annual NLCD satellite images. It includes preprocessing of images, pixel-level segmentation for detecting geographical features (e.g., water bodies, forests), trend analysis of land-use changes over time, and predictive modeling. The goal is to provide insights into how geographical aspects have evolved over the years and predict future changes.

Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure that the following dependencies are installed:

Python 3.x
Pip (for installing Python packages)
You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Project
Follow the steps below to run the project:

Step 1: Prepare the Data
Ensure your raw NLCD images and corresponding metadata files are placed in the following directory structure:

kotlin
Copy code
data/
├── raw/
│   ├── region_1/
│   ├── region_2/
│   └── region_3/
Each region folder should contain the TIFF images.

Step 2: Preprocess the Data
To preprocess the images and sort them chronologically based on the metadata, run the preprocess.py script. This will also resize the images if needed for model training.

bash
Copy code
python scripts/preprocess.py
This will organize the images into the data/processed/ folder, sorted by year for each region.

Step 3: Analyze the Geographical Aspects
Next, you can run the analyze.py script to detect geographical features (like water bodies, forests) and calculate their areas. This analysis will be saved in the data/analysis_results/ directory.

bash
Copy code
python scripts/analyze.py
Step 4: Train the Predictive Model
To train the model for predicting land-use trends, run the train_predictor.py script. This will use the processed images and analysis results to train a model saved in the models/ directory.

bash
Copy code
python scripts/train_predictor.py
Step 5: View the Interactive Dashboard
After running the analysis, you can create an interactive dashboard using dashboard.py. The dashboard will allow you to select a region and year, then display a pie chart showing the geographical aspect areas and a graph indicating trends over time.

bash
Copy code
python scripts/dashboard.py
Step 6: Main Script
If you want to run the full pipeline (preprocessing, analysis, and model training), simply execute the main.py script. This will automatically call the necessary scripts in sequence.

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Folder Structure
data/raw/: Contains raw satellite images and metadata files.
data/processed/: Contains processed and sorted images for training or analysis.
data/analysis_results/: Stores the results of area calculations and geographical aspect detections.

scripts/: Contains all the Python scripts for preprocessing, analysis, training, and dashboard creation.
requirements.txt: Lists all the required Python packages.
Dependencies
The project requires the following Python packages, which are listed in requirements.txt:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
geopandas
opencv-python
dash (for the interactive dashboard)
Install them using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
